## Creating Walls

Every structure starts with a foundation. Lets create a **sector**.

![3D Tutorial Step1](3d_tutorial1.png)

I selected the back and right **linedefs** of the **sector** and selected the [Extrude Linedef](/docs/creator/actions/#extrude-linedef) action which extrudes a linedef (by a given distance and angle) into a new **surface**.

<Admonition type="note" title="Surface">
    A **surface** is the same as a **sector**, I just use it to differentiate flat 2D sectors from 3D ones.
</Admonition>

Applying the [Extrude Linedef](/docs/creator/actions/#extrude-linedef) action results in two new **surfaces** with the linedefs as their basis.

I also used the [3D Iso Camera](/docs/creator/actions/#3d-iso-camera) action to switch to a 3D view of the scene.

I selected the two **surfaces** we just created and selected the [Extrude Sector](/docs/creator/actions/#extrude-sector) action.

When we *Apply* the tool we can see that the wall has now depth.

I used the [Toggle Editing Geometry](/docs/creator/actions/#toggle-editing-geometry) action to hide the editing geometry.

<Admonition type="note" title="Non Destructuve Workflow">
    Extrusions are non destructive. You can apply a new extrusion depth anytime by just re-applying  the [Extrude Sector](/docs/creator/actions/#extrude-sector) action. Including to going back to no extrusion by setting the depth to 0.0.

## Cutting Holes

Lets cut a hole in a wall for a passage. To do that we select the right wall and select the [Set Editing Surface](/docs/creator/actions/#set-editing-surface)  action.

![3D Tutorial Step4](3d_tutorial4.png)

After applying the action (or if you have *Automatic* mode enabled you just need to click on it) you see the editing profile of the surface.

![3D Tutorial Step5](3d_tutorial5.png)

The turquoise outline shows you the boundaries of the surface you are adding profile details into.

Here I added a sector for a door into the profile. Each **sector** you add to a **surface profile** creates a hole by default. When you activate the isometric camera again you can see the result in 3d (I also applied a tile to the walls).

<Admonition type="note" title="Extrusion and holes">
    Holes in profile surfaces are independent from the extrusion of the wall itself. You can change the depth of the wall extrusion and the holes will automatically adjust.
