Actions do the real work in the **Eldiron Creator**. From maximizing the dock widget to creating geometry or switching cameras. It is a centralized system which only displays actions which are currently applicable (depending on the selected geometry, project tree item and camera).

Actions listed in blue represent camera based actions, red actions are applicable to the current content of the **geometry editor**, while yellow are applicable to the content of the **dock widget**.
