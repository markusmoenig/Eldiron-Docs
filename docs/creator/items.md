## Creating and Editing Items

Creating and editing **items** in Eldiron works **just like** working with [Characters](/docs/creator/CHARACTERS/).

### How to Create an Item
1. Click the **+** button in the [Item](/docs/creator/sections/#item) section.
2. Edit its **behavior** using the **Code Tool**.
3. Set its **attributes** using the **Data Tool**.
4. Drag the item into the **map** to create an **instance**.

:::important
Make sure to read the [Characters](/docs/creator/characters) chapter, as items share many of the same principles, including scripting and event handling.

## Creating Item Visuals in Eldiron

As with characters, you can either use a `tile_id` to represent the visuals of an item or create the item directly inside Eldiron.

Creating items inside Eldiron allows the item to colorize character sectors or attach its geometry to character linedefs. You can do this using the following statements in the item’s **Data** tool:

```TOML
# When the item is equipped, specifies the names of sectors whose colors should be overridden with the item's color.
# This is useful when you don’t want to override the geometry but just the color of a character’s nodegraph.
color_targets = ["left_leg", "right_leg"]

# When the item is equipped, specifies the names of linedefs this item geometry should be attached to.
# If 'geo_targets' is not present, Eldiron checks if there is a linedef with a name equal to the item's slot name.
# Use 'geo_targets' only if you want to attach the item geometry to multiple linedefs.
geo_targets = ["left_shoulder", "right_shoulder"]
```

## Item Events

Items receive **System and User events** in the same way as characters.

### Example Events:
- If a **player bumps into an item**, the item receives the **`bump_player`** event.
- If the **user clicks an item**, the item receives the **`click`** event.

This makes items **highly flexible**, allowing them to interact with the **map and characters** in different ways depending on the **game style** you are creating.
