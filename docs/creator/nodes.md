Nodes in Eldiron can fulfill multiple roles depending on the context.
In **Regions**, they can modify and colorize terrain.
In **wall profiles**, **characters**, **items**, and **materials**, they can pixelize sectors and linedefs.

Click on **Create Graph** to create a new graph with a suitable start node for the current context.
Attach nodes to the graph, and when finished, press the **Apply** button to apply the graph to the selected geometry.

In the map, a turquoise highlight indicates which linedefs or sectors share the same graph as the currently selected one.
