I originally planned to release new versions every 2\u20133 weeks, but this round is taking a bit longer\u2014I\u2019m deep in core systems that need to be just right before moving forward.\\n\\n## Render Graph\\n\\nI\u2019ve been integrating the new render graph system, which defines how the scene is drawn using a node-based approach. This allows plugging in effects like fog, ambient lighting, or even a fully procedural sky. More interestingly, this system ties directly into the map\u2019s geometry\u2014vertices, linedefs, and sectors.\\n\\nYou can now attach nodes directly to geometry to define local effects like lighting or fog, tweak terrain blending, or control glossiness and reflection on tiles. These graphs are reusable across multiple areas, making it easy to organize logic and effects in a modular way.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just visual fluff\u2014eventually, these nodes will also drive gameplay interactions. Think of a node that defines a magical barrier, a trigger zone, or a destructible structure. The goal is to unify rendering, behavior, and logic into a single editable system.\\n\\nAnd yes\u2014this applies not just to 3D but also to 2D and isometric modes. The same systems work across all views, which keeps things consistent and flexible.\\n\\n## Terrain System\\n\\nThe new terrain tool lets you sculpt elevation with custom brushes\u2014raise, lower, smooth, or roughen areas as you see fit. Tiles and materials blend automatically using rules, so you can paint smooth transitions and beautiful terrain with minimal effort.\\n\\nAll of this ties into the render graph too, which means terrain isn\u2019t just a visual element\u2014it can be procedural, dynamic, and reactive.\\n\\nThe inspiration is somewhere between \u201cretro charming\u201d and \u201cearly WoW Vanilla\u201d\u2014natural, stylized, and smooth, but still performant and easy to work with.\\n\\n## Asynchronous Streaming Terrain and Geometry\\n\\nTo support massive maps, terrain and geometry are now chunked and streamed in and out as needed. Unlike a game engine that only cares about the player\u2019s position, Eldiron Creator has to update everything live as you edit.\\n\\nThat means background threads rebuild chunks, update render data, blend tiles, and apply node graphs without freezing the UI. It\u2019s been a lot of low-level work, but it\u2019s finally paying off\u2014terrain edits feel smooth, and you can paint or modify geometry interactively.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next\\n\\nI\u2019m currently working on the first pass of procedural path nodes\u2014letting you carve winding roads and trails that modify elevation and materials based on rules. These will connect with the graph system too, opening up possibilities for bridges, stairs, or terrain-aware gameplay triggers.\\n\\n\u2014\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for now! Thanks again for following along\u2014and for your support, especially on Patreon. The next version will be out once it\u2019s stable and fun to use.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMarkus"},{"id":"/2025/04/24/eldiron-v0.8.23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/04/24/eldiron-v0.8.23","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-24-eldiron-v0.8.23.md","title":"Eldiron v0.8.23 Released \u2014 Procedural Materials!","description":"Eldiron v0.8.23 is now available, introducing support for procedural materials.","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":0.67,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Moenig","title":"Eldiron maintainer","url":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/markusm"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/markusmoenig","github":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/markusmoenig.bsky.social"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/markusmoenig.png","key":"markusm"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.23 Released \u2014 Procedural Materials!","authors":["markusm"],"tags":["releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Eldiron Development Update 1","permalink":"/blog/2025/05/16/eldiron-devupdate"},"nextItem":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.22 Released","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/09/eldiron-v0.8.22"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Eldiron v0.8.23** is now available, introducing support for procedural materials.\\n\\n![Material](/img/screenshots/materials.png)\\n\\nThe new material system allows you to assign node-based effects to geometry, enabling tileable, unique materials for use in both 2D and 3D maps \u2014 fully integrated within Eldiron.\\n\\nCurrent node types include color, distance-based gradients, and noise overlays.
