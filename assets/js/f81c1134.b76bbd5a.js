The entity will be transferred to the center of the destination sector.\\n- New `[light]` data attributes to enable light emission for entities and items.\\n- New \'set_emit_light(True / False)` cmd to enable / disable light emission for an entity or an item.\\n- New special `active` item attribute which specifies if the item is active or not. On startup (or if the attribute is changed) a new `active` event is send to the item which can than decide what to do based on the value, like enabling / disabling light emission for a torch.\\n- New `intent` system. Define the current player intent (like \\"talk\\", \\"use\\", \\"open\\" etc.) via the new `intent` parameter for button widgets. Server will send new `intent` events to both entities and items for direction based and click based item interations.\\n- New `health` config attribute which holds the name of the default entity health attribute, by default `HP`.\\n- New `mode` entity attribute which holds the current state string of the entity. Set to `active` on entity instantiation and `dead` when the health attribute is smaller or equal to 0.\\n- New `death` event send to an entity when the health attribute is smaller or equal to 0.\\n- New `id` command which returns the id of the current entity.\\n- New `took_damage` command (my_id, from_id, damage_amount). This command sends out messages and checks for death.\\n- New `goto` command (sector name, speed). Makes an NPC go to a sector. Sends `arrived` event on arrival with the name of the sector as value.\\n- New  `close_in` command (target id, target radius, speed). Makes an NPC close in (in weapon range given by the target radius) of the entity id with the given speed. Once the target is in range a `closed_in` event is send.\\n- New `kill` event send to the attacker when he kills his target. The value of the event is the id of the dead target.\\n\\n### Client\\n\\n- New `intent` command to invoke an intention via key shortcuts (same as actions).\\n\\n### Creator\\n\\n- Tileset tool: Preview icons now in the minimap.\\n- Tilepicker: Icons preview on hover in the minimap.\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Make game widgets honor the global render graph.\\n- Info viewer did not show item values correctly.\\n- Changed `Data` tool shortcut from `A` to `D`.\\n- When adding tiles to the project the background renderer was not updated correctly.\\n- Adjust Undo / Redo state when switching regions.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n- Cleaned up and refactored the reference section of the documentation of Eldiron.com.\\n- Wrote documentation in the reference for all new features and changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe plan is to finish the remaining missing core gameplay mechanics in the next 1-2 releases (and feature them in the Hideout 2D example), implement the node based behavior system and after that focus on a 3D Dungeon crawler example. Than we are not too far away from version 1!\\n\\nI will create a new video showcasing all the new features soon, so don\'t forget to check and subscribe to the YouTube channel!\\n\\nTake care,\\nMarkus"},{"id":"/2025/06/16/eldiron-v0.8.4_rigging","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/06/16/eldiron-v0.8.4_rigging","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-16-eldiron-v0.8.4_rigging.md","title":"New Video | Rigging","description":"\ud83c\udfa5 New Video is Live!","date":"2025-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":0.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Moenig","title":"Eldiron maintainer","url":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/markusm"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/markusmoenig","github":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/markusmoenig.bsky.social"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/markusmoenig.png","key":"markusm"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"New Video | Rigging","authors":["markusm"],"tags":["releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.50 Released","permalink":"/blog/2025/07/16/eldiron-v0.8.50"},"nextItem":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.40 Released","permalink":"/blog/2025/06/13/eldiron-v0.8.40"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfa5 New Video is Live!\\n\\n\ud83d\udd25 **Eldiron v0.84: Rigging** is here \u2014 and it\u2019s a game changer!\\n\\nIn this update, we introduce **character rigging** and **equipment attachment**, letting you build modular animated heroes with swords, shields, and more.

I originally planned to release new versions every 2\u20133 weeks, but this round is taking a bit longer\u2014I\u2019m deep in core systems that need to be just right before moving forward.\\n\\n## Render Graph\\n\\nI\u2019ve been integrating the new render graph system, which defines how the scene is drawn using a node-based approach. This allows plugging in effects like fog, ambient lighting, or even a fully procedural sky. More interestingly, this system ties directly into the map\u2019s geometry\u2014vertices, linedefs, and sectors.\\n\\nYou can now attach nodes directly to geometry to define local effects like lighting or fog, tweak terrain blending, or control glossiness and reflection on tiles. These graphs are reusable across multiple areas, making it easy to organize logic and effects in a modular way.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just visual fluff\u2014eventually, these nodes will also drive gameplay interactions. Think of a node that defines a magical barrier, a trigger zone, or a destructible structure. The goal is to unify rendering, behavior, and logic into a single editable system.\\n\\nAnd yes\u2014this applies not just to 3D but also to 2D and isometric modes. The same systems work across all views, which keeps things consistent and flexible.\\n\\n## Terrain System\\n\\nThe new terrain tool lets you sculpt elevation with custom brushes\u2014raise, lower, smooth, or roughen areas as you see fit. Tiles and materials blend automatically using rules, so you can paint smooth transitions and beautiful terrain with minimal effort.\\n\\nAll of this ties into the render graph too, which means terrain isn\u2019t just a visual element\u2014it can be procedural, dynamic, and reactive.\\n\\nThe inspiration is somewhere between \u201cretro charming\u201d and \u201cearly WoW Vanilla\u201d\u2014natural, stylized, and smooth, but still performant and easy to work with.\\n\\n## Asynchronous Streaming Terrain and Geometry\\n\\nTo support massive maps, terrain and geometry are now chunked and streamed in and out as needed. Unlike a game engine that only cares about the player\u2019s position, Eldiron Creator has to update everything live as you edit.\\n\\nThat means background threads rebuild chunks, update render data, blend tiles, and apply node graphs without freezing the UI. It\u2019s been a lot of low-level work, but it\u2019s finally paying off\u2014terrain edits feel smooth, and you can paint or modify geometry interactively.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next\\n\\nI\u2019m currently working on the first pass of procedural path nodes\u2014letting you carve winding roads and trails that modify elevation and materials based on rules. These will connect with the graph system too, opening up possibilities for bridges, stairs, or terrain-aware gameplay triggers.\\n\\n\u2014\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for now! Thanks again for following along\u2014and for your support, especially on Patreon. The next version will be out once it\u2019s stable and fun to use.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMarkus"},{"id":"/2025/04/24/eldiron-v0.8.23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/04/24/eldiron-v0.8.23","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-24-eldiron-v0.8.23.md","title":"Eldiron v0.8.23 Released \u2014 Procedural Materials!","description":"Eldiron v0.8.23 is now available, introducing support for procedural materials.","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":0.66,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Moenig","title":"Eldiron maintainer","url":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/markusm"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/markusmoenig","github":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/markusmoenig.bsky.social"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/markusmoenig.png","key":"markusm"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.23 Released \u2014 Procedural Materials!","authors":["markusm"],"tags":["releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Eldiron Development Update 1","permalink":"/blog/2025/05/16/eldiron-devupdate"},"nextItem":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.22 Released","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/09/eldiron-v0.8.22"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Eldiron v0.8.23** is now available, introducing support for procedural materials.\\n\\n![Material](/img/screenshots/materials.png)\\n\\nThe new material system allows you to assign node-based effects to geometry, enabling tileable, unique materials for use in both 2D and 3D maps \u2014 fully integrated within Eldiron.\\n\\nCurrent node types include color, distance-based gradients, and noise overlays.
