Previously it was only possible to code behavior for entities and items by programming directly in Python. Now, with the upcoming node system you have an easy-to-use mechanism to define behavior via a grid based node system.\\n\\nThis breaks complex mechanisms into small, easily editable components and even provides feedback and / or errors during runtime.\\n\\n![Nodes](/img/eldiron-nodes-preview.png)\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nYou can drag and drop instructions, values or new events into the code grid (in the *Code Tool*). In the screenshot you can see the **startup** and **intent** events.\\n\\nThe **startup** event here has two instructions, **random_walk_in_sector** and **add_item**. You can see that each argument of the instruction is individually selectable and has its own descriptive text. This makes it possible to easily enter the values via the user-interface and to type-check that values are of the correct type.\\n\\nWhen the server is running, each instruction optionally provides feedback of its status and / or error. For example in the screenshot we typed the name of the *GoldenKey* item wrong and **add_item** complains that it cannot find the item which it is supposed to add to the entities inventory.\\n\\n## A slightly more complex example\\n\\n![Nodes](/img/eldiron-nodes-preview2.png)\\n\\nHere we create a random value between 1 and 10 and if the value is greater than or equal to 5 we add a torch to the inventory. Note that the **random** instruction visually displays during runtime that the resulting number was *6* and **add_item** displays *Ok* to indicate that the item was added successfully.\\n\\n## Automatic creation of grid elements and code\\n\\nWhen you drag an *assignment*, *conditional* or *function* into the grid, the basic grid structure is filled out automatically, you just need to enter values or replace values via drag and drop, it\'s that easy.\\n\\nThe nodes are converted to type-checked **Python** code on the fly.\\n\\n## Advantages of the Grid Node System\\n\\n* Break complex behavior down into individual cells.\\n* Type-check values and arguments.\\n* Fast-code creation.\\n* Visual feedback for function results and errors during runtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI am currently working on porting the Hideout2D example to the new node system and will then release a new version with an explainer video. The new version will probably be ready in 1-2 weeks.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMarkus"},{"id":"/2025/08/08/eldiron-v0.8.60","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/08/08/eldiron-v0.8.60","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-08-eldiron-v0.8.60.mdx","title":"Eldiron v0.8.60 Released","description":"This release features some important new mechanics like the new vendor / multiple choice system, a new text formatting and localization system for messages and new inventory screen widgets.

Also a major refactoring of the server code to increase performance and make it Web compliant.\\n\\nAs well as many other new features and fixes. As always you can try all new features in the updated Hideout2D example.\\n\\nI will update the documentation on the Website in the next days and create a new video.\\n\\n## New Features\\n\\n### Creator\\n\\n- The `Data Tool` now supports direct sector selections in the map. Making it easier to select and edit widgets who are mostly data driven.\\n- Button widgets have new capabilities\\n  - **active** - Boolean, switch if the widget is active by default\\n  - **show** - String array of widgets to show when clicked\\n  - **hide** - String array of widgets to hide when clicked\\n  - **deactivate** - String array of button widgets to deactivate when clicked\\n- New `inventory_index` attribute for button widgets to display the inventory item at the given index.\\n- Intent based actions now also work on items in the inventory (when an intent is active and an inventory button is clicked).\\n- Material node graphs can now be created for screen widgets, allowing procedural borders and content for screen widgets.\\n\\n### Client\\n\\n- Messages widgets now support some new config strings: `multiple_choice` the color for multiple choice items (like inventory sales) and `column_width` to define the maximum size of item columns for multiple choice items.\\n- New localisation and text formatting system, the server may now generate strings like ```{you_bought} {I:{}.name, article=indef, case=lower}``` which gets automatically resolved by the client. Characters and items also can send strings like this now, allowing for powerful in-game text formatting and localization.\\n\\n### Server\\n\\n- New `drop` function to drop a specific item with the given id.\\n- Refactored some code to make sure all actions / intent are executed correctly on items on the map **and** on items in inventories.\\n- **Major refactoring of the server instancing code. Removes the ref_thread_local dependency and enables rayon parallelism, which in turn finally enables web deployment**.\\n- New `wealth` attribute for entities which defines the initial characters wealth in the base currency.\\n- New multiple choice system, implemented right now for inventory sales which vendors can initiate via the new `offer_inventory` command after receiving an intent. `offer_inventory` takes two arguments, the target entity id and a filter string, if empty, i.e. \\"\\", all items are offered.\\n- block_events() now supports specific intents via \\"intent: attack\\", this allows for blocking specific intents for a given amount of time. Previously it was only possible to block all intents via \\"intent\\".\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Rect tool content was not shown in the screen editor.\\n- Items in an inventory had a bug during creation which prevented them to be used with events later on.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Gameplay](/img/solo_screen_v0860.png)\\n\\nThe next version (probably v0.90) will entirely focus on the new node system, long awaited and much requested.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMarkus"},{"id":"/2025/07/16/eldiron-v0.8.50","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/07/16/eldiron-v0.8.50","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-16-eldiron-v0.8.50.mdx","title":"Eldiron v0.8.50 Released","description":"Eldiron v0.8.50 Released","date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":2.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Moenig","title":"Eldiron maintainer","url":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/markusm"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/markusmoenig","github":"https://github.com/markusmoenig","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/markusmoenig.bsky.social"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/markusmoenig.png","key":"markusm"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.50 Released","authors":["markusm"],"tags":["releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Eldiron v0.8.60 Released","permalink":"/blog/2025/08/08/eldiron-v0.8.60"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Video | Rigging","permalink":"/blog/2025/06/16/eldiron-v0.8.4_rigging"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Eldiron v0.8.50 Released\\n\\nAfter I was mostly working on the graphical aspects of Eldiron in the last releases, this release focuses on the core gameplay mechanics.\\n\\n## New Features\\n\\n### Server\\n\\n- New \'entered\' and \'left\' entity system events when entering / leaving named sectors.\\n- New \'teleport\' command which either takes one argument (destination sector name in the same region) or two, the destination sector name and the name of the destination region (which will transfer the character to a different region). The entity will be transferred to the center of the destination sector.\\n- New `[light]` data attributes to enable light emission for entities and items.\\n- New \'set_emit_light(True / False)` cmd to enable / disable light emission for an entity or an item.\\n- New special `active` item attribute which specifies if the item is active or not. On startup (or if the attribute is changed) a new `active` event is send to the item which can than decide what to do based on the value, like enabling / disabling light emission for a torch.\\n- New `intent` system. Define the current player intent (like \\"talk\\", \\"use\\", \\"open\\" etc.) via the new `intent` parameter for button widgets. Server will send new `intent` events to both entities and items for direction based and click based item interations.\\n- New `health` config attribute which holds the name of the default entity health attribute, by default `HP`.\\n- New `mode` entity attribute which holds the current state string of the entity. Set to `active` on entity instantiation and `dead` when the health attribute is smaller or equal to 0.\\n- New `death` event send to an entity when the health attribute is smaller or equal to 0.\\n- New `id` command which returns the id of the current entity.\\n- New `took_damage` command (my_id, from_id, damage_amount). This command sends out messages and checks for death.\\n- New `goto` command (sector name, speed). Makes an NPC go to a sector. Sends `arrived` event on arrival with the name of the sector as value.\\n- New  `close_in` command (target id, target radius, speed). Makes an NPC close in (in weapon range given by the target radius) of the entity id with the given speed. Once the target is in range a `closed_in` event is send.\\n- New `kill` event send to the attacker when he kills his target. The value of the event is the id of the dead target.\\n\\n### Client\\n\\n- New `intent` command to invoke an intention via key shortcuts (same as actions).\\n\\n### Creator\\n\\n- Tileset tool: Preview icons now in the minimap.\\n- Tilepicker: Icons preview on hover in the minimap.\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Make game widgets honor the global render graph.\\n- Info viewer did not show item values correctly.\\n- Changed `Data` tool shortcut from `A` to `D`.\\n- When adding tiles to the project the background renderer was not updated correctly.\\n- Adjust Undo / Redo state when switching regions.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n- Cleaned up and refactored the reference section of the documentation of Eldiron.com.\\n- Wrote documentation in the reference for all new features and changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Gameplay](/img/solo_screen_v0850.png)\\n\\n\\nThe plan is to finish the remaining missing core gameplay mechanics in the next 1-2 releases (and feature them in the Hideout 2D example), implement the node based behavior system and after that focus on a 3D Dungeon crawler example.

I originally planned to release new versions every 2\u20133 weeks, but this round is taking a bit longer\u2014I\u2019m deep in core systems that need to be just right before moving forward.\\n\\n## Render Graph\\n\\nI\u2019ve been integrating the new render graph system, which defines how the scene is drawn using a node-based approach. This allows plugging in effects like fog, ambient lighting, or even a fully procedural sky. More interestingly, this system ties directly into the map\u2019s geometry\u2014vertices, linedefs, and sectors.\\n\\nYou can now attach nodes directly to geometry to define local effects like lighting or fog, tweak terrain blending, or control glossiness and reflection on tiles. These graphs are reusable across multiple areas, making it easy to organize logic and effects in a modular way.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just visual fluff\u2014eventually, these nodes will also drive gameplay interactions. Think of a node that defines a magical barrier, a trigger zone, or a destructible structure. The goal is to unify rendering, behavior, and logic into a single editable system.\\n\\nAnd yes\u2014this applies not just to 3D but also to 2D and isometric modes. The same systems work across all views, which keeps things consistent and flexible.\\n\\n## Terrain System\\n\\nThe new terrain tool lets you sculpt elevation with custom brushes\u2014raise, lower, smooth, or roughen areas as you see fit. Tiles and materials blend automatically using rules, so you can paint smooth transitions and beautiful terrain with minimal effort.\\n\\nAll of this ties into the render graph too, which means terrain isn\u2019t just a visual element\u2014it can be procedural, dynamic, and reactive.\\n\\nThe inspiration is somewhere between \u201cretro charming\u201d and \u201cearly WoW Vanilla\u201d\u2014natural, stylized, and smooth, but still performant and easy to work with.\\n\\n## Asynchronous Streaming Terrain and Geometry\\n\\nTo support massive maps, terrain and geometry are now chunked and streamed in and out as needed. Unlike a game engine that only cares about the player\u2019s position, Eldiron Creator has to update everything live as you edit.\\n\\nThat means background threads rebuild chunks, update render data, blend tiles, and apply node graphs without freezing the UI. It\u2019s been a lot of low-level work, but it\u2019s finally paying off\u2014terrain edits feel smooth, and you can paint or modify geometry interactively.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next\\n\\nI\u2019m currently working on the first pass of procedural path nodes\u2014letting you carve winding roads and trails that modify elevation and materials based on rules. These will connect with the graph system too, opening up possibilities for bridges, stairs, or terrain-aware gameplay triggers.\\n\\n\u2014\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for now!
