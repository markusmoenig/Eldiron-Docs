## Eldiron v0.8.40 Released

Eldiron v0.8.40 introduces a range of major new features for building retro-style RPGs:

- **Character rigging and animation**
  Define and animate character rigs directly within the editor.

- **Item rigging and attachment**
  Equip characters with items that carry their own geometry and animation, attaching cleanly to character slots.

- **Terrain editing and procedural modification**
  Use sectors and linedefs combined with a node-based system to modify terrain heightmaps and colorization.

- **Node-based render graphs**
  All geometry in Eldiron—including characters, terrain, and items—is now driven by flexible, modular node graphs.

- **Asynchronous terrain and geometry streaming**
  Large environments now stream in and render smoothly in the background.
