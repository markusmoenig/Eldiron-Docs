**Eldiron v0.8.23** is now available, introducing support for procedural materials.

The new material system allows you to assign node-based effects to geometry, enabling tileable, unique materials for use in both 2D and 3D maps — fully integrated within Eldiron.

Current node types include color, distance-based gradients, and noise overlays. Additional nodes and advanced features will follow in upcoming releases.

You can now generate tiles directly from your maps, making Eldiron a fully self-sufficient game creation environment.
