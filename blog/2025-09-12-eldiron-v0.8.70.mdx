The main new feature of this release is the new **grid based node system** for coding character and item behavior via drag and drop!

The new video is now live [here](https://youtu.be/UBq5kWRjBTw).

## Advantages of the Grid Node System

* Break complex behavior down into individual cells.
* Type-check values and arguments.
* Fast-code creation.
* Visual feedback for function results and errors during runtime.

## New Features

### Creator

- Character and item classes can now be renamed via their context menus.
- New grid based node editor for coding entity and item behavior in the code tool. **The main new feature for this release.**

### Server

- Removed `get_entity_attr` and `get_item_attr` and replaced it with `get_attr_of` which works for both entities and items.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed deletion of character and item instances in the map (the map would not immediately update sometimes).

Take care,
