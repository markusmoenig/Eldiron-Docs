# General Features

- Design 2D maps in a Doom-style editor using vertices, linedefs, and sectors to create textured polygons.
- Quickly *paint* with tiles using the **Rect** tool, which automatically generates the necessary geometry as you work.
- Import your **tilesets**, define **animations** and **metadata**, and expand your tile collection. You can easily set tile propertiesâ€”such as whether a tile is blockingâ€”at any time. Visit our [Patreon Shop](https://www.patreon.com/c/eldiron/shop) for a growing collection of **tilesets**; supporting us there helps the project.
- Access all commands in Eldiron Creator through the **Action list**. Available actions update automatically based on your geometry selection or UI state, so you always know which commands are ready to use.
- Program character and item behaviors, as well as **advanced shaders**, with intuitive **visual node editors**.
- Eldiron Creator is **cross-platform**, available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** in the download section of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/releases). Each release includes builds for all clients, including the **Web**. An **Xcode project** is also provided for specialized **iOS**, **macOS**, and **iPadOS** builds.

Eldiron is free and open source under the MIT license â€” your [support](sponsor) is greatly appreciated.

# 3D Features

- **3D editing** is seamlessly integrated into the editor, allowing you to **create new geometry** or **extrude** and edit **surface profiles** **non-destructively**.  
- The **Action** system is fully integrated with the **geometry workflow**, showing all available actions for your **current selection**.  
- **Edit** and **extrude** surfaces **non-destructively**, including carving holes for **windows**, **recesses**, and **reliefs**.  
- Choose from **isometric**, **first-person**, or **orbit** cameras for flexible editing views.  
- **Gizmos**, **visual helpers**, and a new **GPU-based renderer** are in active development.

3D editing features are currently under heavy development.

# Visual Node System for Behavior and Shaders

- Create behavior visually with a **node-based event system** using simple drag and drop.  
- React to **world events** (like a character entering a sector or a conversation starting) by breaking complex logic into small, manageable tasks.  
- Choose from a wide range of built-in **events** and **commands**.  
- Build **procedural materials** and effects with a similar system for **shaders**.  

Eldiron provides powerful tools to make world building intuitive and fun.
