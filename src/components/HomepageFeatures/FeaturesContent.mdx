<Admonition type="warning" title="Development Status">
Eldiron is in active development. I work on it regularly—often weekly, sometimes almost daily. It’s a big project and very much a hobby and passion project at the moment.

Because of that, I can’t give fixed dates for when you’ll be able to ship a finished game. I want to keep development sustainable and enjoyable, and not turn it into a source of stress. That said, things are moving forward steadily, and with high probability Eldiron will reach v1 sometime in 2026.

Thank you to everyone who supports the project and follows along on this journey.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Documentation out of Date">
Now with the release of Eldiron v0.89 the current documentation is very much out of date. I will update the documentation and create new videos in the next days and weeks.

# General Features

- Design 2D maps in a Doom-style editor using vertices, linedefs, and sectors to create textured polygons.
- Quickly *paint* with tiles using the **Rect** tool, which automatically generates the necessary geometry as you work.
- Import your **tilesets**, define **animations** and **metadata**, and expand your tile collection. You can easily set tile properties—such as whether a tile is blocking—at any time. Visit our [Patreon Shop](https://www.patreon.com/c/eldiron/shop) for a growing collection of **tilesets**; your support helps the project thrive.
- Access all commands in Eldiron Creator through the **Action list**. Available actions update automatically based on your geometry selection or UI state, ensuring you always know which commands are ready to use.
- Define character and item behaviors with an intuitive **visual node editor** or the inbuilt custom scripting language called **Eldrin**.
- Eldiron Creator is **cross-platform**, available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** in the download section of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/releases). Each release includes builds for all platforms, including the **Web**. An **Xcode project** is also provided for specialized **iOS**, **macOS**, and **iPadOS** builds.

Eldiron Creator currently ships with localizations for Chinese (Mandarin), German, Russian, Spanish and Taiwanese.

Eldiron is free and open source under the MIT license — your [support](sponsor) is greatly appreciated.

# 3D Features

- **3D editing** is seamlessly integrated into the editor, allowing you to **create new geometry** or **extrude** and edit **surface profiles** **non-destructively**.
- Render your scenes in 3D using the new **GPU-based raytracer**, featuring ambient occlusion, shadows, transparency, PBR materials, and day/night time simulation.
- The **Action** system is fully integrated with the **geometry workflow**, displaying all available actions for your **current selection**.
- **Edit** and **extrude** surfaces **non-destructively**, including carving holes for **windows**, **recesses**, and **reliefs**.
- Choose from **isometric**, **first-person**, or **orbit** cameras for flexible editing views.
- Paint with tiles on 3D surfaces using the **Rect** tool.

With Eldiron you can **create great looking 3D geometry** without any prior 3D modelling experience.

# (Visual) Scripting

- Create behavior visually with a **node-based event system** using simple drag and drop. The node system generates **Eldrin** code.
- React to **world events** (like a character entering a sector or a conversation starting) by breaking complex logic into small, manageable tasks.
- Choose from a wide range of built-in **events** and **commands**.
- See realtime feedback if commands succeeded or failed.
- You can also program directly in the inbuilt, custom scripting language **Eldrin**.

# Tiles, Tiles and more Tiles

- **Pixel art** tiles are the foundation of all your projects, in both 2D and 3D. Import them from your tilesets or create and edit them in the **integrated** tile editor.
- Draw with tiles using the **Rect** tool—even in 3D, you can paint directly on surfaces.
- Tiles in 3D are rendered with PBR materials (**Roughness**, **Metallic**, **Opacity**, **Emissive**). Material attributes can currently be set with the **Set Tile Materials** action; soon you'll be able to paint directly with materials inside the tile editor.
- Focusing on tiles makes Eldiron both **easy-to-use** and powerful, recreating the look of those beloved games from the late 80s and 90s.
- Soon the tile editor will support procedural tile creation for fireballs, explosions, bricks, and more.

# World building

World building is the core focus of Eldiron. The editor is designed around the idea that a world is more than geometry or visuals — it is a structured space with rules, relationships, and long-term evolution.

- Create worlds using **explicit structure**: vertices, linedefs, sectors, surfaces, and profiles define space in a way that is deterministic and inspectable.
- Combine **2D and 3D workflows** seamlessly — author top-down maps, then extend them vertically into fully explorable 3D environments without switching tools.
- Define **world logic alongside geometry**: events, behaviors, and scripted interactions are attached directly to places and entities in the world.
- Worlds remain **editable at every stage**. Geometry, tiles, materials, and logic can be refined iteratively without destructive baking steps.
- Eldiron worlds are designed to be **system-driven**, making them suitable not only for games, but also for simulations, experiments, and rule-based environments.

Eldiron aims to make worlds understandable, adaptable, and sustainable — so they can grow over time instead of being rebuilt from scratch.
