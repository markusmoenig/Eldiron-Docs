# General Features

- Design 2D maps in a Doom-style editor using vertices, linedefs, and sectors to create textured polygons.
- Quickly *paint* with tiles using the **Rect** tool, which automatically generates the necessary geometry as you work.
- Import your **tilesets**, define **animations** and **metadata**, and expand your tile collection. You can easily set tile propertiesâ€”such as whether a tile is blockingâ€”at any time. Visit our [Patreon Shop](https://www.patreon.com/c/eldiron/shop) for a growing collection of **tilesets**; supporting us there helps the project.
- Access all commands in Eldiron Creator through the **Action list**. Available actions update automatically based on your geometry selection or UI state, so you always know which commands are ready to use.
- Program character and item behaviors, as well as **advanced shaders**, with intuitive **visual node editors**.
- Eldiron Creator is **cross-platform**, available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** in the download section of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/releases). Each release includes builds for all clients, including the **Web**. An **Xcode project** is also provided for specialized **iOS**, **macOS**, and **iPadOS** builds.
